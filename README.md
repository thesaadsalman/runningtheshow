# Running The Show: The Automated AD Toolbox

Running The Show is a program I'm designing to automate as many parts of the paperwork an Assistant Director has to do as possible.

Here are the feature's I'm currently working on:

* Weather Block: Hate having to google "Sunrise/Sunset Times" and "Weather on X day" every single time you need to make a call sheet? Look no further. With the Weather Block, simply input the zipcode of your shooting location and the days you want the data for, and voila! It'll return Sunrise/Sunset times, the High/Low, and a basic weather forcast for each day.
