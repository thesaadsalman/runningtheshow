# Running The Show: The Automated AD Toolbox

#### Running The Show is a program I'm designing to automate as many parts of the paperwork an Assistant Director has to do as possible.

Here are the features I'm currently working on:

* Weather Block: Hate having to google "Sunrise/Sunset Times" and "Weather on X day" every single time you need to make a call sheet? Look no further. With the Weather Block, simply input the zipcode of your shooting location and the days you want the data for, and voila! It'll return Sunrise/Sunset times, the High/Low, and a basic weather forcast for each day. 

###### The title for this application was lovingly inspired by *Running the Show: The Essential Guide to Being a First Assistant Director*, a fantastic guide to being a First AD, which you can purchase from Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Running-Show-Liz-Gill/dp/0367187388/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1RVJ5XUMNXNV5&keywords=running+the+show&qid=1682216893&sprefix=running+the+sho%2Caps%2C176&sr=8-1). Not sponsored, just a really good book.
